# Fastify Starter

A full-stack project starter, which is basically just a combination of the following tools:
- Alpine
- Fastify
- HTMX
- Mongoose
- Tailwind
- Twig

## Getting Started

1. Get MongoDB running locally.
2. Duplicate `.env.example` and get your ish together.
3. Run `npm i` for that big ol' node_modules folder.
4. Run `npm run gen:key` to generate session key.
5. Run `npm run dev` to kick that server up and get going!
